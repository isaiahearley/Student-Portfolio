            <h2>How Safe is Automated Driving?</h2>

           <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; As computers advance more and more we start to see them integrated into everything from 
                cooking appliances, to washers, dryers and even belts! These devices are known as IoT or 
                Internet of Things which in summary is any type of device that can communicate and exchange data 
                with other devices and systems over the 'internet'
           </p>

           <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; So what do these companies such as <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" 
                target="_blank">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/?utm_source=google&utm_
                medium=paid_search&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4omaBhDqARIsADXULuUVtLZgileyk4aRMfnNbEzz0pNI9FzsVmt2XxCh
                9Upxuxf6Jiq6nWEaAvv6EALw_wcB" target="_blank">Lucid</a>, and <a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/" 
                target="_blank">Porsche</a> have to do with these IoT devices? Well these car manufacturers have 
                developed technologies inside of their cars that have helped propel the "self-driving" car or 
                whatever the companies have named it such as Tesla's "Autopilot", Porsche's "Innodrive", 
                Lucid's Dreamdrive, Hyundai and Kia's HDA 1 and 2... The possibilities are endless! Here is 
                where the real talk begins. What are the differences, the pros and cons for each iteration
                and whether their hefty price tags are worth the safety precaution. 
            </p>


           <p> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot" target="_blank">Autopilot</a> as Tesla calls it
                is their own iteration of a "fully" autonomous car. 
        
        
        
            </p>


           <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Porsche's <a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/aboutporsche/christophorusmag
                azine/archive/380/articleoverview/article07/" target="_blank">Innodrive</a> has to be good as well 
                right? I mean they are afterall one of the leading brands in luxury vehicles. 


           </p>


           <p> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; And last but not least... Lucid Dreamdrive! Honestly it has to be my favorite 
                name out of the bunch
