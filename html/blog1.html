            <h2>How Safe is Automated Driving?</h2>

           <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; As computers advance more and more we start to see them integrated into everything from 
                cooking appliances, to washers, dryers and even belts! These devices are known as IoT or 
                Internet of Things which in summary is any type of device that can communicate and exchange data 
                with other devices and systems over the 'internet'
           </p>

           <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; So what do these companies such as <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" 
                target="_blank">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/?utm_source=google&utm_
                medium=paid_search&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4omaBhDqARIsADXULuUVtLZgileyk4aRMfnNbEzz0pNI9FzsVmt2XxCh
                9Upxuxf6Jiq6nWEaAvv6EALw_wcB" target="_blank">Lucid</a>, and <a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/" 
                target="_blank">Porsche</a> have to do with these IoT devices? Well these car manufacturers have 
                developed technologies inside of their cars that have helped propel the "self-driving" car or 
                whatever the companies have named it such as Tesla's "Autopilot", Porsche's "Innodrive", 
                Lucid's Dreamdrive, Hyundai and Kia's HDA 1 and 2... The possibilities are endless! Here is 
                where the real talk begins. What are the differences, the pros and cons for each iteration
                and whether their hefty price tags are worth the safety precaution. 
            </p>


           <p> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot" target="_blank">
                Autopilot</a> as Tesla calls it is their own iteration of a "fully" autonomous 
                car. Although most articles especially those that dislike Elon Musk
                seem to target his investment as "unsafe" and how we are essentially his 
                "guinea pigs" for testing his beta software there is no doubt that this is 
                the most developed self-driving software out for the public. Although there 
                are several skeptics here are a list of pros and cons I can provide from first-hand 
                experience.  
            </p>

            <ul class="article-left">
                <li>Pros:</li>
                <li>-Good Software</li>
                <li>-Constantly updated</li>
                <li>-"Better" than normal drivers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Cons:</li>
                <li>-Expensive</li>
                <li>-Under constant scrutiny</li>
                <li>-People sleeping during use</li>
            </ul>


           <p class="clear">
                &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/aboutporsche/christophorusmag
                azine/archive/380/articleoverview/article07/" target="_blank"> Porsche's Innodrive</a> has to be good as well 
                right? I mean they are afterall one of the leading brands in luxury vehicles. Well one thing many 
                critics seem to agree with is how not luxurious their self-driving software is compared to Tesla. 
                Although their cars are extremely comfortable no matter the year and make, most porsche's drive
                great behind-the-wheel and may the the reason their software department slacked behind Tesla for 
                quite some time, and for good reason. Many diehard porsche fans aren't in the market for Teslas and 
                simply want a car that drives as good as it feels. That's what porsche does, a car for people who  
                loving driving whereas Tesla seems to be the car for people that don't like driving.  
           </p>

            <ul class="article-left">
                <li>Pros:</li>
                <li>-Affordable</li>
                <li>-Porsche Branded</li>
                <li>-Can handle straight roads</li>
            </ul>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Cons:</li>
                <li>-Has difficulty with curves</li>
                <li>-Doesn't receive many updates</li>
            </ul>


           <p class="clear"> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; And last but not least...<a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/dreamdrive-advanced-driver-assistance-platform
                " target="_blank">Lucid Dreamdrive</a>! Honestly it has to be my favorite name out of the bunch.
                Although the vehicle is still fairly new and doesn't provide DreamDrive Pro the standard 
                self-driving software that comes with every Lucid is great according to a variety of critics.
